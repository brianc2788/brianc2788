Computer Science, Programming. C/CPP - coding these langs for years; learned the fundamentals of programming and exposure to various paradigms.
Currently interested in (seems like everything...):
Relational DB Management / Data Science - These two things have some similar syntax and underlying ideas in common with one-another, imo.
#### Above also includes dabbling in things like Machine Learning and TensorFlow. ####
#### Pentesting! Python is a great lang for the above, and primarily what I use when exploring these concepts, ####
#### but I originally began developing and scripting in python for pentesting. ####
### Have a wide-range of experience in many fields/interests, albeit, said experience is quite shallow. ###
#### Currently having a great summer coding. Doing activities almost all day, every day. ####
## Thanks for checking out my profile and feel free to contact for any reason, I love talking shop. ##
# Have a great night, all. Carpe noctum. #
