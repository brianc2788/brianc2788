## user5260 ##
A computer scientist with interests in a vast array of subjects & disciplines of
systems & network administration, programming, etc.
I tried to outline these interests in a previous Readme, but felt it
was too difficult to produce, aggregate, and maintain.
Basically, if there exists a topic on any given technology, i probably have an opinion
about it - generally somewhere in the range of 'hobbyist/beginner' to 'expert/professional.'

The phrase "Jack of all trades, master of none" comes to mind.
