## Computer History ##  
---
I couldn't really call this list 'CS Heroes' or anything like that;
not everyone I list will be constrained by the title 'computer scientist'.
***Disclaimer*** *Undoubtedly, I'll forget to mention some, even great individuals.*
*Also, this is not necessarily in any order.*
*What's more, the status of people listed will range from 'heroic' to 'oh yeah, that person.'*

People that I admire in a range of computer-related industries:
- Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie (for reasons including, but not limited to, the C Programming Language)
- Ada Lovelace
- Bjarne Stoustrup
- Ken Thompson
- People from AT&T during the golden age.
- Steve Wozniak
- Chuck Peddle
- Bill Shockley
- Linus Torvalds
- Fredericco Faggin
- Alan Turing (*Clearly, this list is in no order.*)
- Tim Berners-Lee
- A lot more people i don't know from xerox parc probably.

After a single, ten-minute sitting, I think I'll let  
myself be satisfied with the list.  
I can smh at myself later on, when i recall someone i forgot to add.
