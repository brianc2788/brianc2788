## Computer History ##

I couldn't really call this list 'CS Heroes' or anything like that;
not everyone I list will be constrained by the title 'computer scientist'.
***Disclaimer*** *Undoubtedly, I'll forget to mention some, even great individuals.*
*Also, this is not necessarily in any order.*
*What's more, the status of people listed will range from 'heroic' to 'oh yeah, that person.'*

People that I admire in a range of computer-related industries:
- Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie (for reasons including, but not limited to, the C Programming Language)
- Ada Lovelace (Credited as the first 'programmer.' More legit than Grace H., imo)
- Bjarne Stoustrup (C w/Classes, AKA C++)
- Ken Thompson (Creator of Unix & Co-Creator of the Go Programming Language)
- People from AT&T during the golden age.
- Gary Kildall (Creator of CP/M & founder of Digital Research)
- Stewart Chiefet (The Computer Chronicles TV show host and creator of 'The Cheiffet 
- Steve Wozniak (Co-Founder of Apple Computers and genius)
- That Dutch guy that created Python
- Chuck Peddle (6502 Microprocessor family from MOS Technology)
- Bill Shockley & those two guys who did all the work for him. (Father of silicon tech & silicon valley. WWII Counter-Intelligence)
- Linus Torvalds (Linux Kernel)
- Fredericco Faggin (Created one of Intel's first highly-successful microprocessor (only microcontrollers until then?), the Intel 8080)
- Alan Turing (*Clearly, this list is in no order.* Turing Machine, contributions to math and foundational CS)
- Tim Berners-Lee (HTML & the World Wide Web. W3C - WWW Consortium.)
- People from Xerox PARC who created GUIs & Windows
- More - So many more. Lol.
